    "comment": "The diagnosis is technically accurate, with a clear explanation of the issue and its relation to the 5G NR standards. The log snippet is correctly interpreted, and the importance of the `absoluteFrequencySSB` parameter is well-understood. A minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the potential consequences of this failure on the overall system performance or to suggest a verification step for the `absoluteFrequencySSB` value before initialization.",
