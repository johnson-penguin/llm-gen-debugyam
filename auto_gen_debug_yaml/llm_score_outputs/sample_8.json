    "comment": "The diagnosis is technically accurate and well-explained, with proper references to 3GPP TS 38.104. The relation between the `dl_frequencyBand` parameter and the SSB raster configuration is clearly stated. The explanation of how the assertion failure impacts the OAI's initialization logic is also well articulated. The only minor improvement could be to explicitly mention the expected range or valid values for `start_gscn` to further clarify the expected configuration.",
