  symptom: "Invalid MNC length configured for the PLMN"

    - "[CONFIG] config_check_intval: mnc_length: 1 invalid value, authorized values:"

    - "plmn_list.mnc_length"
  notes: |
    The failure occurs during the gNB-CU's initial configuration parsing stage, before any protocol stacks are initialized. The OAI configuration parser has detected an invalid value for the `mnc_length` parameter.

    According to 3GPP TS 23.003, the Mobile Network Code (MNC) component of the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID must be either 2 or 3 digits long. The configuration file attempts to set `mnc_length` to `1`, which is an invalid value. The OAI gNB's internal configuration check (`config_check_intval`) correctly rejects this value, leading to a startup failure.

    This configuration is critical for the RRC layer, as it is used to construct the PLMN Identity list broadcast in System Information Block 1 (SIB1). An incorrect PLMN ID would prevent UEs from selecting and camping on the cell. The error prevents the CU from starting, thus blocking any subsequent F1AP, NGAP, or RRC procedures.
