  notes: |
    The DU (Distributed Unit) fails to initialize during the `du_init` stage due to an invalid bandwidth index. The error indicates that the `bw_index` used in the `dl_subcarrierSpacing` configuration is out of the valid range. According to 3GPP TS 38.331, the `dl_subcarrierSpacing` parameter is part of the radio resource configuration for the DU, and it must be within the supported range as defined by the `bandwidth_index_to_mhz` array. The invalid `bw_index` leads to an assertion failure in the OAI softmodem, causing the DU initialization to fail. The configuration file difference indicates that the `dl_subcarrierSpacing` parameter might have been incorrectly set, leading to the use of an unsupported or out-of-range `bw_index`. The CU does not log any errors, which suggests that the failure is isolated to the DU initialization process. The root cause is likely due to a misconfiguration or a bug in the DU startup path that handles the `dl_subcarrierSpacing` parameter.
