  symptom: Invalid bandwidth index during DU initialization
  log_snippet:
    - "Assertion (bw_index >= 0 && bw_index <= (sizeof(bandwidth_index_to_mhz)/sizeof(*(bandwidth_index_to_mhz)))) failed!"
    - "Bandwidth index -1 is invalid"

  notes: |
    The DU initialization process failed due to an invalid bandwidth index. This indicates that the DU received a bandwidth index (-1) that is outside the valid range defined by the `bandwidth_index_to_mhz` array. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the `dl_carrierBandwidth` parameter or an incorrect value being passed to the DU during the OAI module initialization. According to 3GPP TS 38.401, the DU must be configured with a valid bandwidth index to operate correctly. The failure in the `get_supported_bw_mhz()` function, as indicated by the log snippet, suggests that the DU cannot find a matching bandwidth index, leading to an assertion failure and the subsequent exit from the OAI softmodem. This failure occurs in the PHY layer, as it is related to the configuration of the radio bandwidth.
