  symptom: "CU fails to initialize due to no active gNB instance found in configuration"

  notes: |
    The failure occurs during the initial configuration phase of the CU, specifically within the `NRRCConfig()` function responsible for parsing the gNB's RRC (Radio Resource Control) and related parameters.

    The root cause is a misconfiguration of the `Active_gNBs` parameter in the CU's configuration file. This parameter is a list that specifies which gNB instance(s) defined in the configuration file should be initialized. In the failed case, this list is likely empty or commented out.

    Consequently, the OAI configuration parser does not find any gNB instances to load, resulting in the internal variable `RC.nb_nr_inst` (number of NR instances) being set to 0. The gNB application logic, however, has an assertion check that requires at least one gNB instance to be configured (`RC.nb_nr_inst == 1`). This assertion fails, leading to the immediate termination of the CU process. This is a fundamental configuration error that prevents the RRC layer and the entire gNB application from starting up.
