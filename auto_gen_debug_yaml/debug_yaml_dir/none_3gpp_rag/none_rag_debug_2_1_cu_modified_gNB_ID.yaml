- stage: cu_init
  type: CU
  symptom: "gNB_ID not found in configuration"
  log_snippet:
    - "Assertion (config_isparamset(gnbParms, 0)) failed!"
    - "gNB_ID is not defined in configuration file"
    - "../../../openair2/E1AP/e1ap_setup.c:132 RCconfig_NR_CU_E1() Exiting OAI softmodem: _Assert_Exit_"

    - "gNB_ID"
  notes: |
    The failure occurred during the CU initialization phase when the gNB_ID parameter was missing from the configuration file. According to 3GPP TS 38.401, which details the O-RAN architecture and interfaces, the gNB_ID is a crucial identifier for the gNB (gNodeB). Without this identifier, the CU cannot properly initialize and establish a connection with the DU. The error logs indicate that the configuration validation failed because the gNB_ID parameter was not set, leading to the termination of the OAI softmodem initialization process as per the OAI module behavior defined in 3GPP TS 38.401.
