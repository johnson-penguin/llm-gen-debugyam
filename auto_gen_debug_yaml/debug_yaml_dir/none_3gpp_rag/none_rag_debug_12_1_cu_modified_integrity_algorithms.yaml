  notes: |
    The configuration difference for the CU indicates a change in the security.integrity_algorithms parameter. This parameter is related to the security algorithms used for integrity protection during the initial connection setup. A failure in this parameter can prevent the gNB from establishing a secure connection with the DU, leading to a failed initialization. Since there is no error log from the CU, it suggests that the failure occurred early in the initialization process, potentially during the RRC connection setup or the S1 connection establishment, as per 3GPP TS 38.401 for NR and OAI behavior in the context of the gNB initialization.

  notes: |
    The absence of an error log from the CU's perspective may indicate that the error occurred before any logging mechanisms were triggered or that the error was not captured due to a misconfiguration. Given the change in the security.integrity_algorithms parameter, it is possible that the new algorithms are not compatible with the DU or the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). This misconfiguration could lead to a failure in the RRC connection setup or the establishment of the S1 connection, as described in 3GPP TS 38.401 for NR. The root cause could be a mismatch in the supported algorithms between the CU and DU or a misconfiguration in the RIC's control plane, which is responsible for managing the RAN configuration and ensuring that the CU and DU are compatible.

  notes: |
    The failure in the gNB initialization process, indicated by the absence of an error log from the CU, suggests that the configuration change in the security.integrity_algorithms parameter may have led to a compatibility issue. This parameter is crucial for establishing a secure and trusted connection between the CU and DU. The failure could be due to the CU attempting to use an integrity protection algorithm that is not supported by the DU, or due to a misconfiguration in the RIC that fails to properly relay the new security settings to the CU. According to 3GPP TS 38.331 for NR, the integrity protection algorithms are part of the connection setup and must be compatible between the CU and DU. Additionally, OAI module behavior during the RAN setup phase, as defined in O-RAN specifications, requires that the gNB's configuration is aligned with the RAN Control Plane (RAN CP) to ensure a successful initialization. The root cause of the failure is likely related to this misalignment or incompatibility in the security settings.
