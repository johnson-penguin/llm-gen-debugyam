The CU is unable to resolve the IP address for the F1AP, which is critical for establishing the connection between the gNB and the F1AP.

According to 3GPP TS 38.401, the F1AP initialization requires a successful IP address resolution to proceed with the F1AP setup. The error suggests that there might be an issue with the IP address configuration or the network connectivity that prevents the gNB from resolving the F1AP's IP address. This could be due to incorrect IP address settings, network partitioning, or misconfiguration of the local S-Address. The OAI module behavior, specifically the f1ap_eNB_start function, should be checked to ensure that the IP address resolution process is being handled correctly.","{

Since there is no error log from the CU, we can infer that the DU is unable to successfully update its configuration parameters. The parameters in question are related to the PLMN identity (plmn_list.snssaiList.sst and plmn_list.mcc), the TR-S preference (tr_s_preference), and the local S-Address (local_s_address). These parameters are critical for the DU to establish a connection with the CU and the network. The absence of an error log from the CU suggests that the CU may have already accepted the DU's configuration update, but the DU failed to apply it correctly. This could be due to a mismatch in the configuration values, a communication error during the update process, or a problem with the DU's internal state. The specific 3GPP spec that governs these parameters is TS 38.401, which defines the RRC connection establishment and configuration update procedures. The O-RAN architecture, particularly the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), may also play a role in managing these configurations, but without an error log from the CU, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause within the O-RAN framework.

The failure could be due to a mismatch in the PLMN list, MCC, TR-S preference, or local S-Address between the CU and DU. Since there is no error log from the CU, the issue likely originates from the DU's initialization process. The DU may not have received the correct configuration from the CU, leading to an inability to establish a proper connection. This could be due to a failure in the RRC (Radio Resource Control) signaling process, where the DU does not correctly interpret the configuration parameters sent by the CU. According to 3GPP TS 38.331, the RRC connection establishment process requires that both the CU and DU agree on the PLMN identity, MNC, and other related parameters. If the DU does not receive the correct configuration, it may attempt to initiate a connection with incorrect parameters, leading to a failure. The absence of an error log from the CU suggests that the issue is on the DU side, possibly during the RRC connection establishment or the initial setup phase. The DU's inability to correctly process the configuration parameters could be due to a software bug, a misconfiguration, or a communication error between the CU and DU.

The configuration differences between the working and failed setups suggest that there might be an issue with the S-GW's (Serving Gateway) ability to communicate with the DU (Distributed Unit). The parameters related to the PLMN (Public Land Mobile Network) identity, such as `plmn_list.sst`, `plmn_list.mcc`, and `local_s_address`, are crucial for the initial handover and inter-RAT (Radio Access Technology) communication. If these parameters are not correctly configured, the DU may not be able to establish a successful connection with the S-GW, leading to a startup failure. The `security.ciphering_algorithms` parameter is also essential for secure communication, and any mismatch in the algorithms between the CU and DU could result in a failure to establish a secure connection. This issue could be related to the RRC (Radio Resource Control) layer, as the RRC is responsible for establishing and maintaining the radio connection between the UE (User Equipment) and the network. The absence of error logs from the CU makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause, but the configuration differences are likely the root cause of the failure.","{

The related configuration parameters are `gNB_ID`, `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst`, `plmn_list.mcc`, and `local_s_address`. These parameters are essential for the CU to identify itself and establish communication with the DU. The failure could be due to an incorrect value or format of one or more of these parameters, which is not allowed by the O-RAN and 3GPP specifications. Specifically, the `plmn_list.snssaiList.sst` parameter is crucial for the S1-MME to perform the S1-MME-S1AP mapping and establish the S1 interface, as per TS 38.401.
