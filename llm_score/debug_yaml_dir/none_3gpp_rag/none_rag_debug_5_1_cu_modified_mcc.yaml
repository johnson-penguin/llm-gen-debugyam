  notes: |
    The failure occurs during the initial configuration parsing of the gNB CU. The root cause is an invalid value for the Mobile Country Code (MCC) within the PLMN list.

    According to 3GPP TS 23.003, the MCC is a 3-digit decimal number, restricting its valid range to 000-999. The configuration file attempts to set the MCC to 1000, which is out of this specified range.

    The OAI configuration module (`RC.conf`) performs sanity checks on parameters during startup. The log message `config_check_intrange` indicates that this specific check failed, causing the CU initialization process to abort.

    This is a critical failure as the PLMN identity (MCC+MNC) is fundamental for the gNB's operation. It is used by the RRC layer to form the `plmn-IdentityList` broadcast in System Information Block 1 (SIB1) and by the NGAP layer to identify the gNB to the 5G Core (AMF). Without a valid PLMN ID, the gNB cannot start and will not be able to serve any UEs.
