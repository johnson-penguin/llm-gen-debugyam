  notes: |
    The failure occurs during the gNB-CU's initial configuration parsing stage. The root cause is an invalid value for the Slice/Service Type (SST) within the S-NSSAI (Single Network Slice Selection Assistance Information) configuration.

    According to 3GPP TS 23.501, the SST is an 8-bit unsigned integer, which restricts its value to the range of 0 to 255. The configuration file attempts to set the SST to 256, which is outside this valid range.

    The OAI configuration parser (`RC.conf`) performs sanity checks on all parameters before proceeding with protocol stack initialization. The `config_check_intrange` function flags this violation, leading to a fatal error and preventing the CU from starting. This configuration is critical for the RRC layer, as the S-NSSAI list is broadcast to UEs in System Information Block 1 (SIB1) to enable network slice selection. An invalid value here makes the RRC configuration inconsistent with 3GPP specifications, hence the startup is aborted.
