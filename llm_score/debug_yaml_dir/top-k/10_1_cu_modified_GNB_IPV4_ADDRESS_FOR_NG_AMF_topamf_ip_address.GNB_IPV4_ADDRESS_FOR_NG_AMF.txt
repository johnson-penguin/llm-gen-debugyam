[From 29303-g40]:
NOTE 1: The 5G-AN (NG-RAN and N3IWF) is responsible for initiating the SCTP connectivity and setting up the NG-C association with the AMF. This requires the 5G-AN to first obtain the AMF\'s IP address(es).

[From 38300-ge0]:
NOTE: The NG-RAN node may use different source and/or destination IP end point(s) if the SCTP establishment towards one IP end point fails.
