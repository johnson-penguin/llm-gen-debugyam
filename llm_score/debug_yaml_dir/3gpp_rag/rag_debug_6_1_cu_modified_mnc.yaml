  notes: |
    The failure occurs during the gNB-CU's initial configuration parsing stage. The OAI configuration module checks the validity of parameters before proceeding with the initialization of protocol stacks.

    The log indicates that the provided Mobile Network Code (MNC) value of `1000` is invalid. The MNC is a component of the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) ID, which is broadcast in System Information Block 1 (SIB1) and is essential for network identification.

    According to 3GPP TS 23.003, an MNC consists of 2 or 3 digits. This translates to a numerical range of 0 to 999. The configured value `1000` is outside this standard-defined range. The OAI gNB's internal configuration checker (`config_check_intrange`) enforces this constraint, leading to a fatal error and preventing the CU from starting. This check happens before the RRC or NGAP layers are initialized, as a valid PLMN is a prerequisite for their operation.
