  notes: |
    The gNB-CU initialization failed due to an invalid value for the Mobile Country Code (MCC) in the configuration file.

    The MCC is a component of the Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) identity, which is broadcast by the gNB in System Information Block 1 (SIB1) as part of the PLMN-IdentityInfo IE. According to ITU-T recommendation E.212 and 3GPP TS 23.003, the MCC is a 3-digit code, which restricts its value to the range 000-999.

    The OAI configuration parser enforces this constraint during startup. The log message `config_check_intrange: mcc: 1000 invalid value, authorized range: 0 999` clearly shows that the provided value of 1000 is outside the permissible range.

    This failure occurs at the RRC configuration stage within the CU, as the RRC layer is responsible for managing system information. An invalid MCC prevents the gNB from forming a valid PLMN ID, leading to an initialization halt. Correcting the `plmn_list.mcc` parameter to a valid 3-digit number is required to resolve this issue.
